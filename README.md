cd FullMC
Download MC from: https://nextcloud.nms.kcl.ac.uk/apps/files/?dir=/T2KSK/atm_minituples/SF.2021 using cadaver -> 'mget sk4*'
root -b AddAtmpdFriendWeights.cxx -> Adds ATMPD event-by-event weights from friend tree into mtuple
sh HaddMC_500yr.sh -> Merges all 100yr samples into one file

At this point, can rm *100yr* and pcmc_500yr*

sh RunScript_T2KReweight_MAQEh.sh -> Creates MAQEh weights
root -b AddMAQEWeights.cxx -> Adds MAQEh weights to mtuple

Can delete *_MAQEh_weights*

cd T2KSKJointFit_MTupleTools/SKSamples
root -b splitMC_AddFFF.C -> Splits mtuples by ATMPDEventType

*** T2KSamples

sh MakeDirectory.sh -> Setup working directories

Copy MC into FullMC

sh RunScript_T2KReweight_MAQEh.sh -> Generate MAQEh weights
root -b AddMAQEWeights.cxx -> Copy MAQEh weights into mtuple

Can delete *_MAQEh_weights*

root -b ApplyLeptonMomentumCut.C -> MC provided by Lakshmi did not apply lepton momentum (OA2022) approach, thus need to apply momentum cut to get back to OA2020 methodology
sh Go.sh -> Split MC by iclass
sh MoveFiles.sh -> Move split files from FullMC to SplitMC

Can delete FullMC/*

python rename.py -> Rename split files to MaCh3 expectation
root -b MakeNormHists.cxx -> Add norm hist to mtuples
root -b RedoFluxWeights_SK.cxx -> Apply 13av7 flux weights
